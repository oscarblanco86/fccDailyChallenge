# 2026 Winter Games Day 8: Luge

# Given an array of five numbers, each representing the time (in seconds) it took a luger to complete a segment of a track, determine which segment had the fastest speed and what that speed was.

# The track is divided into the following segments:

#     Segment 1: 320 meters
#     Segment 2: 280 meters
#     Segment 3: 350 meters
#     Segment 4: 300 meters
#     Segment 5: 250 meters

# The first value in the given array corresponds to the time for segment 1, the second value to segment 2, and so on.

# To calculate the speed (in meters per second) for a segment, divide the distance by the time.

# Return "The luger's fastest speed was X m/s on segment Y.". Where X is the fastest speed, rounded to two decimal places, and Y is the segment number where the fastest speed occurred.


# 1. get_fastest_speed([9.523, 8.234, 10.012, 9.001, 7.128]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 35.07 m/s on segment 5."
# 2. get_fastest_speed([9.381, 7.417, 9.912, 8.815, 7.284]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 37.75 m/s on segment 2."
# 3. get_fastest_speed([8.890, 7.601, 9.093, 8.392, 6.912]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 38.49 m/s on segment 3."
# 4. get_fastest_speed([8.490, 7.732, 10.103, 8.489, 6.840]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 37.69 m/s on segment 1."
# 5. get_fastest_speed([8.204, 7.230, 9.673, 7.645, 6.508]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 39.24 m/s on segment 4."
