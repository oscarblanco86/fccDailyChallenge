# 2026 Winter Games Day 10: Alpine Skiing

# Given a ski hill's vertical drop, horizontal distance, and type, determine the difficulty rating of the hill.

# To determine the rating:

#     Calculate the steepness of the hill by taking the drop divided by the distance.
#     Then, calculate the adjusted steepness based on the hill type:
#         "Downhill": multiply steepness by 1.2
#         "Slalom": multiply steepness by 0.9
#         "Giant Slalom": multiply steepness by 1.0

# Return:

#     "Green" if the adjusted steepness is less than or equal to 0.1
#     "Blue" if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.25
#     "Black" if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.25

# Tests:

#     Waiting: 1. get_hill_rating(95, 900, "Slalom") should return "Green".
#     Waiting: 2. get_hill_rating(620, 2800, "Downhill") should return "Black".
#     Waiting: 3. get_hill_rating(420, 1680, "Giant Slalom") should return "Blue".
#     Waiting: 4. get_hill_rating(250, 3000, "Downhill") should return "Green".
#     Waiting: 5. get_hill_rating(110, 900, "Slalom") should return "Blue".
#     Waiting: 6. get_hill_rating(380, 1500, "Giant Slalom") should return "Black".
