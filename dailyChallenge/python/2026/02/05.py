# Pocket Change

# Given an array of integers representing the coins in your pocket, with each integer being the value of a coin in cents, return the total amount in the format "$D.CC".

#     100 cents equals 1 dollar.
#     In the return value, include a leading zero for amounts less than one dollar and always exactly two digits for the cents.

# 1. count_change([25, 10, 5, 1]) should return "$0.41".
# 2. count_change([25, 10, 5, 1, 25, 10, 25, 1, 1, 10, 5, 25]) should return "$1.43".
# 3. count_change([100, 25, 100, 1000, 5, 500, 2000, 25]) should return "$37.55".
# 4. count_change([10, 5, 1, 10, 1, 25, 1, 1, 5, 1, 10]) should return "$0.70".
# 5. count_change([1]) should return "$0.01".
# 6. count_change([25, 25, 25, 25]) should return "$1.00".
