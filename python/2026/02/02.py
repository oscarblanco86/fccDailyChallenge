# Groundhog Day

# Today is Groundhog Day, in which a groundhog predicts the weather based on whether or not it sees its shadow.

# Given a value representing the groundhog's appearance, return the correct prediction:

#     If the given value is the boolean true (the groundhog saw its shadow), return "Looks like we'll have six more weeks of winter.".
#     If the value is the boolean false (the groundhog did not see its shadow), return "It's going to be an early spring.".
#     If the value is anything else (the groundhog did not show up), return "No prediction this year.".

# Tests:

#     Waiting: 1. groundhog_day_prediction(True) should return "Looks like we'll have six more weeks of winter.".
#     Waiting: 2. groundhog_day_prediction(False) should return "It's going to be an early spring.".
#     Waiting: 3. groundhog_day_prediction(None) should return "No prediction this year.".
#     Waiting: 4. groundhog_day_prediction(" ") should return "No prediction this year.".
#     Waiting: 5. groundhog_day_prediction("True") should return "No prediction this year.".
